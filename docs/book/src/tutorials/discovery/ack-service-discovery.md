# ACK Service Discovery

In this tutorial we use the AWS Controllers for Kubernetes to create an RDS Database and we will configure the Primaza's Service Discovery mechanism to automatically discover the service for us.

## Tutorial

The tutorial is thought to be executed in [Multi-Cluster](../tenant/multi-cluster.md) setup.
Tune-it as needed if running in a different Primaza setup.
