Feature: Forward Service Class into Service namespaces

    Scenario: On Service Class creation, Primaza control plane forwards it into all matching services namespace

        And Worker Cluster "worker" for "main" is running
        And Clusters "main" and "worker" can communicate
        And On Primaza Cluster "main", Worker "worker"'s ClusterContext secret "primaza-kw" is published
        And On Worker Cluster "worker", service namespace "services" exists
        And On Primaza Cluster "main", Resource is created

        Then On Worker Cluster "worker", Resource "ServiceClass" with name "demo-service-sc" exists in namespace "services"
